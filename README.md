# QuickFIX/Go Examples

[![Build Status](https://github.com/quickfixgo/examples/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/quickfixgo/examples/actions) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/quickfixgo/examples?status.png)](https://godoc.org/github.com/quickfixgo/examples) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/quickfixgo/examples)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/quickfixgo/examples)

## About
:wave: Hi! The code in this project showcases common scenarios for FIX applications. The project is structured as an all-in-one cli application that you can easily install on your machine and use it to explore the mechanics behind sending/receiving simple FIX messages. You can also use the cli app as a rudimentary message validator against your own FIX application.

If you are interested in modifying the examples to suit your own purposes, take a look at the sub-applications descriptions below, navigate to their READMEs to get a better sense of the typical ins and outs of FIX apps, then clone the repo and have at it, otherwise, install the cli app.

* [TradeClient](cmd/tradeclient/README.md) is a simple FIX initiator console-based trading client
* [Executor](cmd/executor/README.md) is a FIX acceptor service that fills every limit order it receives
* [OrderMatch](cmd/ordermatch/README.md) is a primitive matching engine and FIX acceptor service

All examples have been ported from [QuickFIX](http://quickfixengine.org)

An initiator with a web UI for visualizing the quickfix messaging interface can be found [here](https://github.com/quickfixgo/traderui)

## Usage
This project builds a cli tool `qf` with 3 commands corresponding to each example.
The generalized usage is of the form:
```sh
qf [GLOBAL FLAGS] [COMMAND] [COMMAND FLAGS] [ARGS]
```

The examples are meant to be run in pairs- the TradeClient as a client of either the Executor or OrderMatcher. By default, the examples will load the default configurations named after the example apps provided in the `config/` root directory.  <i>i.e.</i>, running `qf tradeclient` will load the `config/tradeclient.cfg` configuration.  Each example can be run with a custom configuration as a command line argument (`qf tradeclient my_trade_client.cfg`).


## Installation
In order to use this awesome tool, you'll need to get it on your machine!

### From Homebrew
If you're on macOS, the easiest way to get the examples is through the homebrew tap.
```sh
brew tap quickfixgo/qf
brew install qf
```
Run the command `qf help` in your shell for the list of possible example subcommands.

### From Release
1. Head over to the official [releases page](https://github.com/quickfixgo/examples/releases)
2. Determine the appropriate distribution for your operating system (mac | windows | linux)
3. Download and untar the distribution. Shortcut for macs:
```sh
curl -sL https://github.com/quickfixgo/examples/releases/download/v{VERSION}/qf_{VERSION}_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz | tar zx
```
4. Move the binary into your local `$PATH`.
5. Run the command `qf help` in your shell for the list of possible example subcommands.

### From Source
To build and run the examples, you will first need [Go](https://www.golang.org) installed on your machine

Next, clone this repository with `git clone git@github.com:quickfixgo/examples.git`. This project uses go modules, so you just need to type `make build`. This will compile the examples executable in the `./bin` dir in your local copy of the repo. If this exits with exit status 0, then everything is working! You may need to pull the module deps with `go mod download`.
```sh
make build
```
Run the command `./bin/qf help` in your shell for the list of possible example subcommands.

### From Snapcraft
Linux OS users can install the examples through the snap store.
```sh
sudo snap install quickfixgo-qf
```
Run the command `qf help` in your shell for the list of possible example subcommands.

### From Scoop
Windows users can install the examples via the Scoop package manager.
```sh
scoop bucket add auth0 https://github.com/auth0/scoop-auth0-cli.git
scoop install auth0
```
Run the command `qf help` in your shell for the list of possible example subcommands.

### Docker Image
The quickfix examples are also available as a docker image [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/quickfixgo/qf). To pull and run the `latest`, use the following command:
```sh
docker run -it quickfixgo/qf
```
To run a specific example, you can do something like this:
```sh
docker run -it -p 5001:5001 quickfixgo/qf ordermatch
```
Note: The docker image comes pre-loaded with the default configs. If you want to supply your own, you can specify a volume binding to your local directory in the run command.
